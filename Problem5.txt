a) this part is pretty simple, it goes thoough every cahracter in order from the text and checks if it starts with a U, and if it does
it keeps going down the string and if there is 8 numbers then it checks if it's greater than 28 and ends with a character that isn't a number
it does this by knowing the ascii values of each character and using if statments.

b)

c)This does it by checking the left and right an seeing if they are the same thing, and if they are it increments the right and decrements the left
to branch out to see if it's still a palidrome. it also takes into account where it is on a pivot letter or character. Then it returns the biggest one.
